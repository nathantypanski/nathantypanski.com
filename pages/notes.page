## Writing code

> As a group, software developers don’t practice enough. Most of our learning
> takes place on the job, which means that most of our mistakes get made there
> as well. Other creative professions practice: artists carry a sketchpad,
> musicians play technical pieces, poets constantly rewrite works. In karate,
> where the aim is to learn to spar or fight, most of a student’s time is spent
> learning and refining basic moves. The more formal of these exercises are
> called kata.

### Abstraction

> From a bit to a few hundred megabytes, from a microsecond to a half an hour of
> computing confronts us with completely baffling ratio of 109! The programmer
> is in the unique position that his is the only discipline and profession in
> which such a gigantic ratio, which totally baffles our imagination, has to be
> bridged by a single technology. He has to be able to think in terms of
> conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to
> face before. Compared to that number of semantic levels, the average
> mathematical theory is almost flat. By evoking the need for deep conceptual
> hierarchies, the automatic computer confronts us with a radically new
> intellectual challenge that has no precedent in our history.

## Organization

One thing that bothers me about my efforts to stay organized, even in light of modern computing tech, is that I still simply have no obvious way to portably sync knowledge, todo lists, notifications, etc. between devices.

Sure, I can use Google Calendar for notifications when I'm in my web browser, but what about at a Linux shell? Can I download my task list into a plaintext format? Can I `grep` it?

It seems like, for all of our time spent building better technology, all of our efforts at making life organization easy are dominated by vendor lock-in and proprietary data formats. [Org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) is maybe the best thing out there - but it's a complex beast, and only works marginally well on, e.g., Android.

If you want control over your own data, this is even worse. Then you have to manage a means of syncing it yourself, which is time-consuming and complicated.
