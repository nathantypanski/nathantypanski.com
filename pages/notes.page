> As a group, software developers donâ€™t practice enough. Most of our learning
> takes place on the job, which means that most of our mistakes get made there
> as well. Other creative professions practice: artists carry a sketchpad,
> musicians play technical pieces, poets constantly rewrite works. In karate,
> where the aim is to learn to spar or fight, most of a studentâ€™s time is spent
> learning and refining basic moves. The more formal of these exercises are
> called kata.
