Personality

Sometimes I take personality tests. If I like the results, I also sometimes
post about them here.

I have taken the [Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) (MBTI) once in 2011 and show [INTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP) preferences.
