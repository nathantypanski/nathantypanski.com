I'm also studying [computer engineering](http://www.cnu.edu/pcs/academics/ce.asp)</a> at Christopher Newport University, and am hard at work earning a minor in leadership studies in the [President's Leadership Program](http://presidentsleadership.cnu.edu/).


Personality

I am still regularly taking personality tests and adding results as I encounter them.

I have taken the [Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) (MBTI) once in 2011 and show [INTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP) preferences.
