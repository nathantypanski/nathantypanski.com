I publish
[my mathematics notes](/files/notes.pdf)
for free online under a license that
[permits creative sharing](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

Here are some sample images:

![Trigonometry](/images/mathnotes_tiny.png)

![Sequences](/images/mathnotes_2_tiny.png)

The
[full LaTeX source and all images](https://github.com/nathantypanski/texnotes)
are available for download, editing, and version control on GitHub.
This often has more recent updates than the pdf version here, since I have not
automated rebuilding this pdf when I commit to that repo (though I should!),
but not always. Either way, they usually track each other within at least a
couple of weeks.

If you have any questions, additions, revisions, or suggestions,
[submit a bug report](https://github.com/nathantypanski/texnotes/issues).
