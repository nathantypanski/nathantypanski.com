I'm a student, currently in my fourth year studying computer engineering at [CNU](http://www.cnu.edu/pcs/academics/ce.asp).

You can find some of what I've been doing over at my [worklog](worklog.html). My [blog](blog.html) is about Linux and software development. I also publish my [math notes](tex.html) here, covering basic calculus and discrete mathematics.
