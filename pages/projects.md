### Dotfiles
*Fall 2012*. [GitHub](https://github.com/nathantypanski/dotfiles)

One of the cool things Linux users do is they post their user-level configuration files on the internet for other people to grab. We often have useful scripts, vim configurations, and creative ways of setting our environment variables tucked away in our dotfiles for nobody to see. Now, with sites like GitHub, you can search the vast repositories of user configuration for just the settings you need.

I post mine, too. There's a short writeup with some extra photos about my most recent configuration [over at Imgur](http://imgur.com/a/vPhbb).

### Math notebook
*Spring 2011*. [Webpage](/tex.html). [GitHub](https://github.com/nathantypanski/texnotes)

Once college-level integral calculus hit me I started searching for a better solution to managing my notes. One of the nice things about computerized documents is that you can search them, but math always seemed out of that domain. [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) turned out to be the solution to that problem - I started learning it early into my second semester of college, and ended up writing over 200 pages of notes. Some on discrete math, some on calculus, and a little bit of random tidbits thrown in there. It covers more than just that one class, but the bulk of describes tricky integration, sequences, and series - standard Calc II material.

It's something I'm really proud of, and I still reference them whenever I need a bit of that math knowledge.

The experience as a whole gave me the chance to explore mathematics a little deeper, and to gain some grasp on technical writing. I haven't feared any technical writing projects since then, and I gained an awesome new skill (technical typesetting) for any time I've had to write papers.

### SmartsGarden Visualizer
*Spring 2011*. [GitHub](https://github.com/nathantypanski/SGVisualizer).

I joined a capstone project to build generative music and artwork from network data. It was a team project with two others (although we each built specialized components) and my first serious effort using Git.

I made the music visualizer. Even though it was generated from music, and not visualizing live network data, the results had to *look* like they were coming from a network. I experimented with creating nodes onscreen and drawing them like network graphs, then got them working in resposne to thresholds from a [FFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) of the audio.

We won [CNU](http://cnu.edu/pcs)'s information systems capstone competition that year.
The result was visually impressive, and the others had produced good music from their traffic analysis. My code is written in [Processing](https://www.processing.org/), a sort of Java-lite for the computer graphics and artwork community. As far as I know, only the visualizer component is open-source.

### ZombieRL
*2011*. [GitHub](https://github.com/nathantypanski/zombierl).

As a senior in high school I got the chance to take my fourth and final computer science class as effectively an independent study. It was taught in C++, but I blew through the course material and started exploring other languages and projects to work on. I did the first couple chapters of [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), which I have yet to get back to, and picked up Python in my free time.

The culmination of all this effort was a zombie-themed roguelike in Python. It uses [The Doryen Library](http://doryen.eptalys.net/) to draw graphics to the screen. After working on it for a while I ported it to Python 3, but it hasn't seen much activity since then.

This was my first real intro to ideas like blitting graphics to a screen or having a main loop that had to respond to user input. It was also probably my first project where version control would have helped me.


### MGMT
*2010*. [GitHub](https://github.com/nathantypanski/MGMT).

I took [IB Computer Science](http://www.ibo.org/diploma/curriculum/group5/ComputerScience.cfm) as a Junior in high school. This was my "dossier", a massive final project that makes up half of the curriculum.

It managed customer contacts, but only had a CLI interface. The real beauty of the project was that it forced you to go through a sort of software engineering life cycle that lasted more than a week or two. I had to make diagrams, describe the class interfaces and the way the objects interacted, and all that fun stuff before I could even get started *coding*.
