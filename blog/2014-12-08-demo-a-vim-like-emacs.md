title: Evil-mode configuration demo

In an effort to help out one of my readers, I made a quick Asciicast demo of the first few steps in my [Towards a Vim-like Emacs](/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html) blog post.
Since I figure at least a few others might be interested, I've reproduced it here:[^download]

[^download]: Does anyone know how to download from Asciinema? If so, [drop me a line](/contact.html). I'd love to keep a backup copy of the stuff I upload there.
