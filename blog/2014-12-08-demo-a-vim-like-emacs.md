In an effort to help out one of my readers, I made a quick Asciicast demo of the first few steps in my [Towards a Vim-like Emacs](/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html) blog post.
Since I figure at least a few others might be interested, I've reproduced it here:[^download]

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14201.js" id="asciicast-14201" async></script>

[^download]: Does anyone know how to download from Asciinema? If so, [drop me a line](/contact.html). I'd love to keep a backup copy of the stuff I upload there.

    **Update 2014/01/13:** reader Gabriel Lazar informed me that the data is [available in JSON format](https://asciinema-bb-eu.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asciicast/stdout_frames/14201/stdout.json) and playable, in theory, using a portion of the open-source [asciinema.org code](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema.org). As an alternate backup solution, he suggests recording the playback of a screencast as a video. Thanks, Gabriel!
