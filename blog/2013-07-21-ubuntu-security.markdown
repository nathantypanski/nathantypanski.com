title: Ubuntu Forums Down for Maintenance
tags: linux
---


[Ubuntu forums](http://ubuntuforums.org/announce.html) went down thanks to a yet-unknown vulnerability today. The above image is the defacing that occurred. News comes courtesy of [this reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipmuy/ubuntu_forums_defaced/). [Change your passwords, folks](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/11/changing_passwo.html).

I think this serves as a reminder that this kind of breach could happen to any of us. Am I confident this will never happen to the [Arch forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/)? Not necessarily. Even [kernel.org has been pwned before](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125666).

The maintenance message currently displayed on the forums is posted below:

> Ubuntu Forums is down for maintenance
> ====
