Without diving too far into the strict Haskell (or C.T.) side of things,
I think I should offer some clarification on monoids and how they relate
to what you already know about group theory. Since I couldn't find this
information anywhere else online presented like this.

## Groups and monoids in mathematics

A monoid is a more general structure than a group. A **group** is a set
and a binary operation that has some fairly strict axioms. If we have a
group $G$ with an operation $\cdot$, then the following must hold:

* *Closure*: for all $a$, $b$ in $G$, $a \cdot b$ is in $G$.
* *Associativity*: for all $a$, $b$ in a $G$,
  $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
* *Identity*: There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that for every element
  $a$ in $G$, $a \cdot e = a$.
* *Invertibility*: For every element  $a$ in $G$, there exists an
  inverse element $a^{-1}$ for $a$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1}$ is the identity
  element.

A (mathematical) **monoid** is a set together with a binary operation
with only closure, associativity, and identity requirements.
Thus a monoid is a group where the operator is not necessarily
invertible, and all groups are monoids which also have invertibility.

## Monoids in Haskell

In Haskell we have a builtin typeclass for monoids:

````{.haskell}
class Monoid m where
    mempty :: m
    mappend :: m -> m -> m
    mconcat :: [m] -> m
    mconcat = foldr mappend mempty
````

This means that in order to make a monoid for a type **m** (essentially,
a set $\mathbb{m}$[^sets]) in Haskell, we need to define two things:

- `mempty`, the identity element
- `mappend`, the binary function

Note that mconcat is defined in the typeclass itself. These two
functions must obey the same laws as mathematical monoids:

### Identity

Combining `mempty` with any `x` in **m** must always yield `x`.

````{.haskell}
mempty `mappend` x = x
x `mappend` mempty = x
````

### Associativity

The result of the binary operation is the same, independent of
parenthesization.

````{.haskell}
(x `mappend` y) `mappend` z = x `mappend` (y `mappend` z)
````
### Closure

Closure is enforced by the type signatures provided by the
typeclass for monoids; We see that all operations are closed under the
typeclass **m** in the typeclass definition: `mempty`, `mappend`, and
`mconcat` all have a domain in **m** and a range in **m**. To show this:

`mempty` is the identity element, so it is in **m**.

`mappend` is a function $f$ such that $f(x, y) = z$, where $x$, $y$,
and $z$ are in $\mathbb{m}$. This is by definition how the type signature
`mappend :: m -> m -> m` is read,
though
[currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying)
means this can also be seen as function $f$ such that 
$f(x) = \big(g(y) = z\big)$.

For `mconcat` the property of closure is not immediately obvious, since
`mconcat` operates on a list of elements in **m** instead of just one
element in **m**. To show that Haskell's monoids are still closed within
**m**, we need to know the type signature for foldr:

````{.haskell}
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b.
````
First we define the sets 
$$\mathbb{a} \equiv \textbf{a},\\
\mathbb{b} \equiv \textbf{b}$$
to complete our analogy between Haskell and math.
We can read this as follows: `foldr` is a function $f$ such that

$$ f\big(h(x, y),\, j,\, \mathbb{k}\big) = t, $$

where $\mathbb{k}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{a}$, and $j$, $t$ are in $\mathbb{b}$, and $h$ is a
function of the form

$$ h(x, y) = z, $$

where $x$ is in $\mathbb{a}$ and $y$, $z$ are in $\mathbb{b}$. 
Since `mappend` is a binary function of the form $h(x, y) = z$ where $x$, $y$,
$z$ are in $\mathbb{m}$, and `mempty` is in **m**, in the instance of `mconcat` we can
treat `foldr` as having the type signature

````{.haskell}
foldr :: ((m -> (m -> m)) -> m) -> ([m] -> m)
````

which, when applied to `mappend`, becomes

````{.haskell}
(foldr mappend) :: m -> ([m] -> m)
````

and then, applying this to `mempty`,

````{.haskell}
(foldr mappend mempty) :: [m] -> m.
````

Note that this is the same type signature as

```{.haskell}
mconcat :: [m] -> m.
```

Since Haskell's monoid typeclass is associative by law and one may
prove that
[associativity implies generalized associativity](http://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Associative_implies_generalized_associative),
`mconcat` can be defined by default in the typeclass and follows directly
from Haskell's monoid laws, and the monoid will still remain closed under
**m**.

## Why do monoids matter?

A number of type in Haskell fall under the typeclass `Monoid`.
Besides the mathematical examples, one such type that is interesting to
programmers is `String`:

```{.haskell}
λ import Data.Monoid
λ "abc" `mappend` "def"
"abcdef"
λ mempty :: String
""
λ mconcat ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
"abcdef"
λ mempty `mappend` "abc"
"abc"
λ "abc" `mappend` mempty
"abc"
```

Having a monoid instance for `Int` might seem more obvious at first, but
in practice it is pretty useless. If we choose our operation to be
`(+)`, then we do not get an instance monoid for `Int` where our operation
is `(*)`, etc. But we can do it:[^mappend]

```{.haskell}
import Data.Monoid

instance Monoid Int where
    mempty = 0
    mappend = (+)
```

```{.haskell}
λ let x = 10 :: Int
λ let y = 20 :: Int
λ x <> y
30
λ x <> mempty
10
λ mempty <> x
10
```

Looking at this, we might think it would be useful to write our own typeclass
for `Group`. Luckily for us, there's already one out there! The
[`groups`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups-0.4.0.0)
package provides a typeclass for groups that we can use.

It defines groups like this:
```{.haskell}
class Monoid m => Group m where
    invert :: m -> m
```
So we see: something has to be a Monoid to be a Group, and we have to define
the function `invert` to make it into a group. Armed with this knowledge, we
can make our `Int` Monoid into a tried-and-true Group:

```{.haskell}
λ let x = 3 :: Int
λ let y = 5 :: Int
λ x <> (invert x)
Loading package groups-0.4.0.0 ... linking ... done.
0
λ x <> (invert y) <> y
3
```

[^sets]: In this article, I use blackboard font
(e.g. $\mathbb{Z}$)
to denote a
mathematical set, **boldface** to denote the underlying set behind a
Haskell type, and `monospace` to denote a Haskell type. In many
cases, the way we reason about the two can be
equivalent, e.g. `Int`
can be
[^mappend]: Note that the function `(<>)` is an alias for `mappend`
that is an infix operator instead of prefix, i.e. we can do
```{.haskell}
"abc" <> "def"
```
without enclosing the symbol in backticks (\`) to make it infix.
