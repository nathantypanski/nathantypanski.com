<p>After nearly a month using <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>, I’m back to using the <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3 window manager</a>. Still, this is the longest stretch of tiling wm usage I have ever managed. It might be that I have finally migrated from <a href="http://openbox.org/">openbox</a>, which is by far my all-time favorite floating window manager.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-liked-about-xmonad">What I liked about xmonad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fully customizable in ways you wouldn’t even think a window manager could manage.</li>
<li>Huge, excellent <a href="http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/">community extensions library</a>.</li>
<li>Reminiscent of <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, the code is your configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-didnt-like-about-xmonad">What I didn’t like about xmonad</h2>
<ul>
<li>I still don’t know Haskell.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve been reading books. Everything from <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours">Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours</a> to the oft-recommended <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a>. And while I managed to <a href="https://github.com/nathantypanski/dotfiles/blob/master/.xmonad/xmonad.hs">develop my xmonad.hs to something I was happy with</a>, it still didn’t come close to meeting the built-in features of i3.</p>
<p>Besides, I had already invested my time in <a href="https://github.com/nathantypanski/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/dzen/dz.sh">writing a dzen script for a statusbar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nathantypanski/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config">tricking out my i3 config</a>. While I had thought that i3 lacked features and xmonad would offer greater customization, the reality is that xmonad offers greater power for <em>people who already know Haskell</em>. If, like me, you don’t know Haskell, then i3 is arguably superior. It is written in C, which most Linux people can be expected to be familiar with. Its configs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnYN2CTb1hM#t=15m30s">easy and human-readable from the get-go</a>.</p>
<p>Using xmonad made me better appreciate i3.</p>
<p>When I switched back today, I noticed that the Arch Wiki page had an interesting link to <a href="https://github.com/yiuin/i3-wm-scripts">i3-wm-scripts</a>, a set of Python scripts for manipulating i3. They add vim-esque mark and goto functions to i3, as well as window searching by name (with dmenu) and similar awesome features. Installation was simple: I just cloned the scripts into my <em>~/bin</em> directory and added keybindings from the <em>README</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a bittersweet reunion. I really, <em>really</em> wanted to like xmonad. But the learning curve for programming it just proved too high.</p>
